         <p style="color: #6B4530; text-align: center; font-family:verdana; font-size: 23px">Sasha Braus (Japanese Name: サシャ・ブラウス, also sometimes called "Sasha Blouse") was a character who appeared in AOT. She was a member of the Scout Regiment and a former member of the 104th Cadet Corps. She originated from the village of Dauper, which was in the southern territory of Wall Rose.</p>
         <p style="color: #6B4530; text-align: center; font-family:verdana; font-size: 23px">When we meet her, Sasha is around 16 years old but by the time she dies [spoilerrr ☹], she is around 20 years old. Her father is named Artur Braus and her mother is named Lisa Braus. She also has one adopted sister named Kaya. Her birthday is on July 26th and her occupation is a Soldier. In terms of physical appearance, she has light brown eyes and reddish-brown hair up in a ponytail. Later on though, she cuts it shorter and grows out her bangs. Her usual outfit consists of her uniform.</p>
         <p style="color: #6B4530; text-align: center; font-family:verdana; font-size: 23px">Personality wise, she’s quite upbeat, friendly and bubbly. She also has a local accent but speaks in formal speech in order to hide it. Originally, she was a bit of a klutz and timid, though later on she proved to be quite courageous and have a sharp intuition. She also has an incredible appetite and even steals food from the infantry kitchens (earning her the name “Potato Girl”).</p>
